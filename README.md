# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my professional portfolio website. I have used React, Sass, Sanity CMS, and Framer Motion to create this website. It serves as a showcase of my work, skills, and experiences. The design inspiration of this portfolio website has been taken from JS mastery, and its contribution is duly acknowledged.

## Features

- **React**: The website is built using the React JavaScript library, providing a modular and efficient component-based structure.

- **Sass**: Sass is used as a CSS preprocessor, allowing for the use of variables, mixins, and nested styles, making styling more maintainable and organized.

- **Sanity CMS**: The website is integrated with Sanity CMS, which provides a user-friendly interface to manage and update content, such as project details, about, work, skills sections respectively along with personal informations as well.

- **Framer Motion**: Framer Motion is employed for adding smooth animations and transitions to enhance the user experience and provide a visually appealing presentation.
